## Introduction
This repository contains a number of Jupyter notebooks that are used for various outreach, public engagement, and schools visits as part of my role at the University of Bradford. They are meant to introduce young people to various AI, ML, and electronic and electrical engineering concepts.

This repository should hopefully grow with time and I will do my best to maintain and update the notebooks. 

It is also meant to be used with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) as a way to quickly get these up and running and to get the young people to tinker and experiment as fast as possible, with as few barriers as possible.
